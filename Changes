    - Added timestamps to the log file.
    - Report the start of the hash check as well as the end of it. This way,
      time needed for the hash check will not affect the average bandwidth
      report. The irctor-queue event handlers for rtorrent need to be
      modified for this release. See the docs.
    - Report if (and why) an unrar operation fails.

    - Divide RTorrent's ratio number by 1000 so it will actually be a ratio
    - Adjust RTorrent configuration docs to use $d.get_tied_to_file instead
      of $d.get_loaded_file. This should fix incorrectly reported download
      times after restarts.
